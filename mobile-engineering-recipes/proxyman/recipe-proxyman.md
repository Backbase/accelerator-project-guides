# Recipe - Proxyman
# The problem

During project development, oftentimes it happens that BE capabilities are not implemented completely (or test data is only partially available), and Mobile Engineers (as well as QAs) struggle with how to reproduce particular scenarios.

# The solution

[**Proxyman**](https://proxyman.io/ "https://proxyman.io/") is a high-performance macOS app, which enables developers to view HTTP/HTTPS requests from apps and domains, including iOS devices, iOS Simulators, Android devices, and Android emulators.

### **Debug on devices**

Keep in mind that if you are using a real device or simulator/emulator, there are some additional setup to be done:

*   [![](./recipe-proxyman-1.png)iOS Simulator](https://docs.proxyman.io/debug-devices/ios-simulator)
    
*   [![](./recipe-proxyman-2.png)Android Device & Emulator](https://docs.proxyman.io/debug-devices/android-device)
    

### **Most useful features**

*   [Breakpoint](https://docs.proxyman.io/advanced-features/breakpoint "https://docs.proxyman.io/advanced-features/breakpoint"): helps developers to edit the content of the Request and Response **on the fly**.
    
*   [Map file](https://docs.proxyman.io/advanced-features/map-local "https://docs.proxyman.io/advanced-features/map-local"): enables you to use the content of local files as a response to your requests, which are matched with your rules. Map Local Tool could significantly boost your speed development and provide the capability to rapidly test on several edge-cases without explicitly updating the data in your server.

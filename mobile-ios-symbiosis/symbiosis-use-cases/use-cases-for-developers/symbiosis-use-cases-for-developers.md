Example in action.

Sometimes a certain element is updated through different access points. Which one is the best depends on what you’ll need to do, knowing all of them empowers you to take the right choice.

*   Identify the element.
    
*   Understand the work needed, is it: formatting, styling, business logic?
    
*   Navigate to the screen that contains the element
    
*   [**Tap to reveal**](/wiki/spaces/ES/pages/3909943349 "/wiki/spaces/ES/pages/3909943349") (long press) at the element
    
*   Choose the matching element from the result list
    
*   If the element has different styling points make use of the inline documentation and the context itself to understand which one fits best to your use.

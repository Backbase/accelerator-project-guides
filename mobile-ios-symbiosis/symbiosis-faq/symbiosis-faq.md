# Symbiosis - FAQ
_**Q: I noticed that the app has already some credentials written in it when I open it, is that expected?**_

A: Yes. The app is currently using the sandbox environment and for the sake of simplicity we’re leaving a default credential over there to help people quickly get in to the app.

_**Q: Is this applicable to Model Bank?**_

A: Model Bank is a starting point of a project that uses the prescriptive way of working. It is a clear start for development of a project having all the OOTB BB SKDs in place. It also refers to the practices around SDLC. At the moment, we don’t deploy on Model Bank, as an instance of MB is limited to clients, and have high maintenance costs. We use the Retail Universal app as our first version (imagine it as being a pilot), and we are connecting it to the API Sandbox ([API Sandbox](https://backbase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/pages/3601433032) ). To understand more about Symbiosis, please check out our documentation, and play with our app - [Symbiosis - Use Cases](https://backbase.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ES/pages/4236870482). There you would find more about versions, and what’s coming next.

_**Q: Can we distribute Symbiosis to customers and partners?**_

A: No. As per now Symbiosis is only available for internal usage. We are investigating the possibilities of making releases for other audiences.

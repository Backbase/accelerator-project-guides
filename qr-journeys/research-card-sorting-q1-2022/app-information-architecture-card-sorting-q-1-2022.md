| Client collaboration |     |
| Research objective | To learn how users organise banking activities to determine the information architecture of the app |
| Why we need to do this research | As we are designing a super-app concept, it was critical for us to understand how users can find different features they need on the complex app to complete the tasks they want to do |
| Methodologies | Open card sort |
| How the research was conducted | * Conducted in a workshop format with all participants in the Google Meet<br>    <br>* Each participant was tasked to arrange the cards on their own dedicated space on Miro |
| Participants | N = 6 (BB Internal)<br><br>* Diverse participants of different nationalities (mostly APAC)<br>    <br>* Most are familiar with the existing BB product |

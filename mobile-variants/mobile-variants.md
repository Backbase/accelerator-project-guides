## Concept

Variants aims to _facilitate the setup and usage of multiple deployment variants for a mobile application_ (iOS and Android) while also _providing a fully working and rich Fastlane setup, with opt-in features for your pipelines_. While achieving these goals, it also reduces the amount of sources of truth in your configuration, by relying only on the _**Variants Spec**_ - a YAML configuration file generated by `variants init`.
